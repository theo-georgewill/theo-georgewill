# 👋 Hi, I’m Theo

I’m a full-stack software engineer based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria — focused on building scalable systems with **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, and **WordPress**.

Since 2019, I’ve led, launched, and contributed to platforms used across education, e-commerce, and business automation. My work bridges the gap between client delivery and software architecture.
